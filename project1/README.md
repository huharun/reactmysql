# Project 1

# Cloning the Repository and Running the Project

To clone the repository and get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/huharun/dbms1_project1.git
   ```

6. **Database and Setup environment**:  
   1. Create new Database named project1.
   2. Find the **project1.sql** inside the folder and import in your created Database.
   3. *Make sure the cloned folder inside **xampp/htdocs**.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory and Backend**:  
   Open terminal inside htdocs and locate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd reactmysql/project1/backend
   ```

3. **Run the Project**:  
   Start the project using:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Modify Environment Variables** (if needed):  
   Ensure any necessary environment variables are set in your **`.env`** file.

5. **Change URL in index.js:**(if needed)
If you need to update the API URL in your frontend code, locate the index.js file within your Frontend directory and update the endpoint URLs as necessary to match your backend server.


9. **Enjoy the Application**:  
   Feel free to access some of the Backend endpoints directly such as **`http://localhost:5050/getAll`**. You will only receive JSON data without nice rendering.

   Now you can interact with the Frontend http://localhost/reactmysql/project1/Frontend/index.html.
