# Project 3

# Cloning the Repository and Running the Project

To clone the repository and get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/huharun/dbms1_project1.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory and Backend**:  
   Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd project1/backend
   ```

3. **Run the Project**:  
   Start the project using:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Modify Environment Variables** (if needed):  
   Ensure any necessary environment variables are set in your **`.env`** file.

5. **Enjoy the Application**:  
   Feel free to access some of the Backend endpoints directly such as **`http://localhost:5050/getAll`**. You will only receive JSON data without nice rendering.

   Now you can interact with the Frontend http://localhost/dbms1_project1/Frontend/index.html.
